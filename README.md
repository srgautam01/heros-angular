In this application, I build my own application from the ground up, providing experience with the typical development process, as well as an introduction to basic app-design concepts, tools, and terminology.

I have build this application for real world ready purpose where I can examine and modify in the StackBlitz interactive development environment, where I can see the results in real time.

This Tour of Heroes tutorial shows how to set up local development environment and develop an application using the Angular CLI tool, and provides an introduction to the fundamentals of Angular.

The Tour of Heroes application that I build helps a staffing agency manage its stable of heroes. The application has many of the features we would expect to find in any data-driven application.

The finished application acquires and displays a list of heroes, edits a selected hero's detail, and navigates among different views of heroic data.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.11.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
